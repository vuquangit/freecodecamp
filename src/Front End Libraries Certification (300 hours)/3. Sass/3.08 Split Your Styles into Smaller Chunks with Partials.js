Sass: Split Your Styles into Smaller Chunks with Partials

Partials in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code. These are imported 
and used in other Sass files. This is a great way to group similar code into a module 
to keep it organized.

Names for partials start with the underscore (_) character, which tells Sass it is a 
small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file. Also, Sass files end with 
the .scss file extension. To bring the code in the partial into another Sass file, use 
the @import directive.

For example, if all your mixins are saved in a partial named "_mixins.scss", and they 
are needed in the "main.scss" file, this is how to use them in the main file:

// In the main.scss file

@import 'mixins'

Note that the underscore is not needed in the import statement - Sass understands it 
is a partial. Once a partial is imported into a file, all variables, mixins, and other 
code are available to use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write an @import statement to import a partial named _variables.scss into the main.scss file.
