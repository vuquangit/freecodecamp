Object Oriented Programming: Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object

The last challenge created an object with various properties, now you'll see how to access 
the values of those properties. Here's an example:

    let duck = {
        name: "Aflac",
        numLegs: 2
    };
    console.log(duck.name);
    // This prints "Aflac" to the console

Dot notation is used on the object name, duck, followed by the name of the property, name, 
to access the value of "Aflac".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Print both properties of the dog object below to your console.

    let dog = {
        name: "Spot",
        numLegs: 4
    };
    // Add your code below this line

*/

let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Add your code below this
console.log(dog.name, dog.numLegs);
